/**
 * This interface represents a connection to a database server, although in 
 * reality this is probably more than one connection (probably a pool of them).
 * The main methods used to interact with the database server are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code beginTransaction} will start an open transaction and keep a 
 * dedicated connection for this until you either rollback or commit. Please
 * remember that if you don't properly rollback or commit, the underlying data
 * source may starve out of connections and become unusable.
 * <li>{@code createAutoExecutor} will create an object that exposes methods for
 * sending SQL code to the database server, but will operate in auto commit 
 * mode, and only allocates a connection from the underlying data source when
 * required. You can't starve the data source using auto executors, they can't
 * even be closed as they are stateless.
 * <li>{@code getCatalog} will give you access to the meta data information on
 * the remote server. These objects loads data from the server as you use it
 * </ul>
